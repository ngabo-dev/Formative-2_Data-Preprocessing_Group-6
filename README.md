# Formative 2: Multimodal Data Preprocessing Assignment
## Group 6 - User Identity and Product Recommendation System

### Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive **User Identity and Product Recommendation System** that combines facial recognition, voice verification, and product recommendation capabilities. The system follows a sequential authentication flow where users must pass both facial and voice verification before receiving personalized product recommendations.

### System Architecture

```
User Input → Face Recognition → Voice Verification → Product Recommendation
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
  Image Data    Pre-trained      Audio Sample      Personalized
  Processing    Face Model       Verification      Product List
```

### Key Features

- **Multimodal Authentication**: Combines facial recognition and voice verification
- **Product Recommendation Engine**: Predicts user preferences based on social media and transaction data
- **Real-time Processing**: Command-line interface for system demonstration
- **Security Features**: Unauthorized access detection and prevention
